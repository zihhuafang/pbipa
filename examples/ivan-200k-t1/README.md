Small synthetic diploid test case.
One haplotype is ~200kbp in size. There is one large SV event: haplotype 2 has a 40kbp deletion compared to hap1 located in between 80kbp-120kbp of hap1.
SNPs with 0.003 probability are sprinkled across the entire hap1.
After phasing, this assembly should produce two fully phased long contigs.
Without phasing, only the SV bubble should appear as an associate contig (a bubble).
