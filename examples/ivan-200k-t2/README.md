Small synthetic diploid test case.
One haplotype is ~200kbp in size. There are no SV events, only SNPs with 0.003 probability, in a region between 80kbp and 120kbp of the reference haplotype.
After phasing, this assembly should produce one long contig, and one associate contig in the phased region (a bubble).
